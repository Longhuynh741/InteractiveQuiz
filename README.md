# InteractiveQuiz

# PassGenCode

This Project is aimed towards building upon JavaScript foundations. The completion of this project will require prior knowledge of several Javascript principles including: Arrays, for loops, if/else statements, and variable creations. Newer concepts such as DOM elements will be heavily focused as well. You will be tasked with making an Interactive Quiz. The generator must be able to follow these criteria:

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
```

# Installation

You will start this project from scratch. You are given a demo/preview of the expected results in your class repository. Using your code editor, you will create the html files, css files, java script files, and any other files you feel are relevant. This project will also use BootStrap as an aide so be sure to include the CDN into your project.

# Usage

Use VSS code editor to make changes where neccessary. For this project, be sure to reference the demo to make sure you are on the right track. Make sure the code functions not only on your local branch, but on the published Github website as well.

# Credits

I do not own the original source code which this project is based on. It was provided to me through GA-Tech Bootcamp. Any adjustments I made to the original source code was of my own with guidance and instructions from the bootcamp instructors and classmates.
